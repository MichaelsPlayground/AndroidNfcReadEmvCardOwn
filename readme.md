This is an EMV card reader that tries to read some information about the data stored on an EMV card.

It is running in a very early state and there is no guaranty that

a) the app works

b) the app DOES NOT DESTROY YOUR CARD

Why it may be dangerous to use the app ?

The app send commands to the EMV card by the select command and that could cause a damage on the card.

So better use some outdated/expired cards for your experiments with this app - don't blame me when 
your CreditCard isn't working anymore...
